|=======================================================================

=== Get Help

Passing your mouse cursor over items, such as command buttons,
conversations, or mail addresses in message headers, displays a small text
box of descriptive information about the item.

=== Folder Information

If you hover the cursor over a folder, the number messages in the folder and
the size of the folder display.

== Organizing Your Account

Zimbra Web Client provides several ways to organize items in your
account. You can use these features, such as folders, tags, and flags, along
with the Search feature to quickly locate and retrieve messages.

=== Using Folders

Folders are used to organize your incoming and outgoing email messages. You
can create your own folders, or use the system defined folders:

  * *User-defined folders*. Folders you create to organize your email are
    displayed in the Mail Folders list in the Overview pane. Top-level
    folder names cannot be the same as any other top-level folder in your
    email, calendar, or contacts folders.

  * *System folders*. System folders cannot be moved, renamed, or
    deleted. The following are system folders:

  ** *Inbox*. New email arrives in the Inbox.

  ** *Sent*. A copy of each message you send is saved in the Sent folder.

  ** *Drafts*. Messages you have composed but have not sent are saved in the
     Drafts folder.

  ** *Junk*. Most filtering of unsolicited automated email (also known as
     spam or junk mail) is handled by a spam filter before those email
     messages reach your Inbox. Email that might possibly be junk mail, but
     isn't certain to be junk, can be placed in your Junk folder.  You can
     review these messages and either move them or delete them. If you
     don't delete them, they will be purged after a period of time, as
     specified by your administrator

  ** *Trash*. Deleted items are placed in the Trash folder and remain there
     until you manually empty the trash or until the folder is purged
     automatically.

=== Using Tags

You can use tags to help classify and organize your email messages,
conversations, calendar items, contacts, briefcase, or tasks. For example,
you can have a tag for Immediate Turnaround and another for Medium Priority.

You can tag for tasks or a project tag to sort email, and you can search for
all items with a particular tag. You can also apply multiple tags to an
item.

=== Using Flags

The flag icon in the message list is a yes/no indicator that denotes whether
the email message has been flagged. This can be used to indicate an
action-needed item or to distinguish the message or conversation from other
items of lesser importance.

== Customizing Your Mailbox Initial View

In your Preferences Mail page, *Default Mail Search* specifies the initial
view when you log into your mailbox. The default search is your Inbox
folder. Therefore, when you sign in, the results of your Inbox display.

You can change this to have another folder, tag, or a saved search displayed
when you first open the web client.

  . Go to the *Preferences>Mail* page.

  . In the *Displaying Messages>Default Mail Search* text box specify which
    messages are displayed when you open your mailbox. Enter the search keyword,
    followed by a : (colon) and folder, tag, or a saved search name.
+
The following table lists some examples to enter in the text box.
+
[cols="1,2a", options=""]
|=======================================================================

|*is:unread* |

To display only unread messages

|*tag:<tagname>* |

To display email messages that are tagged with specific tags. For example,
to display only messages marked with the ToDo tag, type tag:ToDo

|*in:<foldername>* |

To display messages that are sent to a specific folder via an email filter

[NOTE]
Use quotes if the folder or tag is more than one word. For example
in:”Unread Email”

|=======================================================================

  . Click *Save*.

== Personalizing the View of Your Account

Your default user preferences are configured when your account is
created. These preferences define how your {product-name} features work. You
can change these settings from the *Preferences>General* page.

=== Change the Theme

The theme for your mailbox interface can be changed. Carbon is the default
theme.

  . Go to the *Preferences>General* page.

  . In the *Appearance* section, select the *Theme* you want to use.

  . Click *Save*.

=== Change the Language

Change the language used to display text.

  . Go to the *Preferences>General* page.

  . In the *Time Zone and Language* section, select the *Language* you want to
    use.

  . Click *Save*.

=== Compose Right to Left

Change the direction of your typing composition from right to left.

  . Go to the *Preferences>General* page.

  . In the *Time Zone and Language* section, select the *Compose Direction* you
    would like to view. Select *Left to Right* or *Right to Left*.
+
If you want to display this feature in the toolbar to be able to toggle,
select *Show direction* buttons in *compose toolbar*.

  . Click *Save*.

If you make a change to the composition direction of your account, when you
click Save a warning displays asking if you want to reload your account
now. Click OK to immediately change the compose direction.

=== Change the Type Face on Your Account Pages

The type of text face used on your account pages can be changed.  Options
include Standard, Modern, Classic, and Wide. The option you select changes
the font face and font size in your view of the ZWC.

  . Go to the *Preferences>General* page.

  . In the *Time Zone and Language>Font* drop-down menu, select the option you
    want to display.

  . Click *Save*

You can also select the *Display Font Size* and *Print Font Size*.

=== Move the Reading Pane

You can change the display to a three-pane view, with the Overview pane on
left, Content pane in the center and the Reading pane on the right.

  * On the toolbar, click *View* and select the *Reading Pane* to display on the
    right, bottom or off.

=== Change the Pane Size

  * For split-pane windows such as the Conversation view, you can use the sash
    to increase or decrease the relative sizes of the upper and lower
    panes. Click and drag on the bar separating the panes.

== Change Your Default Time Zone

The default time zone setting that is displayed in *Preferences>General* is
used to localize the time for received messages and calendar activities in
the standard web client.

When using the standard web client, the time zone on the computer is not
used to set the time a message is received or for calendar activities; the
time zone setting in the *Preferences>General* tab is. However, when using
the advanced web client, the time zone setting on the computer is used to as
the time stamp for received messages and for calendar activities, not the
time zone setting on the *General* page.

The time zone for your account can be different from your computer time
zone.

  . Go to the *Preferences>General* page.

  . In the *Time Zone and Language>Time Zone* drop-down menu select the time
    zone you want to use.

  . Click *Save*.

[NOTE]
Because the advanced web client and the standard web client do not use the
same time zone source to render messages, you might notice that the same
message has a different time when displayed in one or the other client.  You
can avoid this by having the computer time zone and the web client time zone
set to the same time.

== How Address Bubbles Work

Names in the address field display in an email “bubble” rather than as
text. The bubbles are more interactive than email addresses displayed as
text. The following actions are available when using bubbles for email
addresses.

  * When addressing an email, you can right-click on a bubble to display a menu
    of options, including Delete, Edit, Edit Contact.

  * When reading an email message, you can right-click on a bubble to display a
    menu of options, including Add to Contacts, New Email, Find Emails.

  * You can left-click a single bubble and drag and drop it into another address
    field or select multiple bubbles and drag the addresses using the "rubber
    band" selection tool to move bubbles. "Rubber band" selecting is left
    clicking on the white space on the field and dragging a selection box across
    selected bubbles. The selected bubbles are highlighted in blue.  You can now
    drag and drop them to another field.

  * You can use CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste the address.

  * You can tab or use the left/right arrow keys to navigate between bubbles.

  * When autocomplete is used to select a distribution list, the bubble includes
    a + (plus) sign to identify the address as a distribution list. You can
    click the + to expand the list to display distribution list members. You can
    also click on an address in the list to send an individual email to the
    selected addressee.

== Managing Your Account Quota

To manage disk and resource usage, your administrator might enforce quotas
to limit the amount of disk space your account can use.

  * To display your mail quota and how much you have used, hover the mouse over
    your name on the toolbar.

If you are over quota, the following things might happen:

  * You receive an email notification.

  * Your email interface displays a notification when you log in.

  * Email sent to you might be returned to the sender, along with a notification
    that your mailbox is full.

=== Reduce the Size of Your Mailbox

  * Delete old messages that are no longer needed.

  * Delete large file attachments to messages. Save the file attachments locally
    if you want to preserve them.

  * Empty the Trash folder.

Your administrator may have set up automatic purging of messages that are
over a certain number of days old. Your administrator sets the policy for
when messages are purged, how old they have to be, and which folders are
purged.

== Empty Your Trash Folder

The Trash folder is available for each application in your account. When you
open the Trash folder from an application such as Mail, only items for that
application are displayed. But when you select Empty Trash from any of your
applications, items from all applications are deleted.

You can empty your Trash folder any time.

  * Right-click on the Trash folder and select *Empty Trash*. All messages are
    deleted.

Items deleted from Trash are removed from your account and your account
quota is updated.

[NOTE]
Messages might be automatically purged if Trash purge policies are
configured.

== Marking Multiple Messages for the Same Action

Use the check box on the Content pane to select one or more messages or
conversations to perform the same action on.

[NOTE]
If check boxes are not displayed in your Mail view, go to the
*Preferences>General* page and in the Other Settings section, select
Selection, which will display checkboxes to select items in lists.
Selecting the box in the header automatically checks all the messages on the
page.

=== Delete more than one message at once

  . In the *Mail Content* pane, select the boxes for messages that you want to
    delete.

  . Right-click and select *Delete*.

=== Tag more than one message at once

  . In the *Mail Content* pane, select the boxes for messages that you want to
    tag with the same tag.

  . Right-click and select *Tag Conversations*.

  . Select the tag from your list or create a new tag.

=== Print more than one message at once

  . In the *Mail Content* pane, select the boxes for messages that you want to
    print.

  . Right-click and select *Print*.

  . In the Print Box, click *OK*. All the messages are printed as one continuous
    file.

=== Forward more than one message at once

  . In the *Mail Content* pane, select the boxes for messages that you want to
    forward.

  . Right-click and select *Forward*. A message compose page opens with the
    email messages attached.

  . Complete the message and send.

== Setting Up an Out of Office Message

You can create a message that automatically replies to people who send you
messages when you are out of the office.

If you want people who send you email that are not in your domain to receive
a different reply message, you can create a separate reply message.

The auto-reply message is sent to each recipient only once in a specified
interval of days regardless of how many messages that person sends during
that period. The default is seven days but the administrator can change
this.

  . Go to the *Preferences>Out of Office* page.

  . Select *Out of Office>Send auto-reply message*.

  . In the *Auto-Reply Message* text box, type the response to send while you
    are out of the office.

  . If you want this message enabled for a specific time frame, select *Send
    auto-replies during the following time period* and enter the start and end
    dates to send the auto-reply message.
+
If you do not specify a specific time frame, auto-replies are sent until you
select *Do not send auto replies*.

  . (Optional) If you want to send a different message to users outside of your
    domain, select *External Senders*.
+
Select the type of external users to receive the second message. The default
is anyone outside my domain. If you want contacts listed in your address
books to receive the first message, in the drop-down menu select anyone
*outside my domain except those in address book*.

  . Click *Save*.
