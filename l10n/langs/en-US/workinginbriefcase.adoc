== Working in Briefcase

Briefcase can be used to share and manage documents that you create in
Briefcase or documents and images that you upload to your Briefcase
folders. Use Briefcase to save files in your account so that you can access
these files whenever you log in to your account from any computer.

You can share your briefcases folders with others who can view and edit the
files in the shared Briefcase.

You can create multiple briefcase folders and then upload any type of file
from your computer or your computer network, save attachments sent with your
email messages, and create new documents.

Files in Briefcase are copies of the original file, whether the file is on
your computer or an attachment to your email. Changes you make to files in
your briefcase do not change the original file.

=== Creating Briefcase Folders

  . Go to *Briefcase Folders*.

  . Click the *gear icon* and select *New Briefcase*.

  . Enter a *Name* for the new briefcase folder.
+
The briefcase folder name must be unique within the hierarchy of your all of
mailbox folders. This name cannot match any top-level folder in your
mailbox, calendar, or address book. For example, if you have a calendar
named Holidays, you cannot name a top-level briefcase Holidays. Holidays
could be a name of a briefcase within another briefcase.

  . Select the *Color* of the new briefcase file.

  . Select the folder hierarchy, either under Folders or under another briefcase
    folder. You can create a new top-level briefcase, or you can place it under
    an existing briefcase.

  . Click *OK*.

  . Go to the *Briefcase* tab and select the Briefcase to save the file.

  . In the *Notes* text field, add any information about the file. This
    information is displayed in the file list.

  . To add another file, click *Add*.
+
You cannot upload a file with the same name to the same briefcase. If a file
is uploaded that already exists in the folder, an Upload Conflict dialog
displays. You can either click *Yes* to upload the file, overwriting the
existing file, or click *No*.
+
The version number is updated if a file is overwritten.

  . When all files are uploaded, click *OK*.

[NOTE]
If you selected the wrong briefcase, you can use drag and drop to move the
file to the correct Briefcase folder.

If the file is too large, a warning displays. Files that you upload impact
your account quota.
