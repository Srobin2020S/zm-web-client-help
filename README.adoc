==============================================================================================================================================

This repository contains the code necessary to build the Zimbra Web Client Help.

The latest version of the help is available at https://zimbra.github.io/zm-web-client-help

== Building the Help

The Zimbra Web Client Help is written using
link:http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. Specifically, it is intended to be
processed with link:https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

As a prerequisite to building the documentation, you will need to have
already installed and configured
link:http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]. Check the
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#installation-quick-start[Installation
Quick Start] in the
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor User Manual] for
information on how to get started.

Once you have Asciidoctor installed and working, you can build the
documentation into HTML files.

A Makefile is included to make the process easier with a couple of targets:

  * `translate` - A target which runs po4a on the source documents to
    update the content from translations files. This utilizes a
    https://www.docker.com/[Docker] containerized version of po4a. You will
    need to have Docker installed and the `docker` command available for
    this to work.

  * `build` - A target which builds the html documents for each translation.

=== Build web files

  make build

The results will be in `build/LANG/help.html`, where `LANG` is the language
code for the translation.

=== Update the source files based on local translation

  make translate

The language specific versions of the documents will be updated in the
`l10n/langs` directory will be updated based on the contents of `l10n/po`
directory.

== Translations

Translation templates are generated using
https://po4a.alioth.debian.org/[po4a].

Translations for the help is managed with Zanata and is available in the
https://translate.zanata.org/project/view/zimbra-web-help[Zimbra Web Help]
project. You may use the `zanata-cli` tool to update the translations at
any time.

=== Updating translation files

The `po` files for each translated document are in the `l10n/po/LANG`
directory, where `LANG` is the language code (as defined by Zanata). You
can manually overwrite the `po` files with new translated content, if you
are interested in seeing the results of an updated translation. The `po`
files can be directly downloaded from Zanata or updated with some other
tool.

[NOTE]
Pull requests for modified `po` will *NOT* be accepted. Please use Zanata for
updating translations.
