= Searching for Items

== Searching Your Account

Searching lets you find messages, contacts, appointments, tasks, and
files. You can search by specific words, dates, time, URL, size, tag,
whether or not a message has been read, whether it has file attachments or
attachments of a particular file type and more.

The Search feature executes whatever search query is currently displayed in
the search text box. You can enter one of the search key words in the
search field and a list of possible search arguments automatically
displays. In addition, the drop-down arrow at the left of the search text
box allows you to select which type of items to search for. You can select
to search within messages, your contacts, including company contact lists,
appointments, tasks, and files.

You have the option to perform more complex searches by using specific
search query information, such as filters and conditions. You can save your
search queries and re-execute them at a later date.

=== Find an Item Quickly

  . Select the folder that you want to search or in the search drop-down
    menu, select which part of your account to search.

  . In the *Search* text box, type the search text. For search options, see
    <<_search_syntax>>.

  . Press *Enter*. The Search tab opens to display the search results.

=== Perform a Search from the Search Page

  . In the Search box, click the *magnifying glass*. The search page
    displays.

  . In the Navigation pane, select from the drop down links to create your
    search. The search syntax displays in a bubble in the search field at the
    top of page.

== Setting Your Search Preferences

By default your spam, trash and shared items folders are not searched.  You
can enable these preferences. To view the search query syntax in the search
field, you can enable the Search Language preference.

  . Go to *Preferences>General* page.

  . Select *Search>Include Spam Folder in Searches, Include Trash Folder in
    Searches, and Include Shared Items in Searches* to include these folders
    in any search you perform.

  . Select *Search Language>Show advanced search language in search
    toolbar* to show search string details in the search text box at the top
    of the page. By default, this option is not selected.

  . Click *Save*.

== Performing a Quick Search

A quick shortcut to searching is to type in a name or word, without any
keywords. For example, to find all mail containing the word " tim" anywhere
in the subject line, To: From: Cc: or Bcc: lines, message body, or file
attachment, you could simply type tim into the search box and click
*Search*.

You can enter any value, such as a word, first name, last name, phone
number, or domain name. For contacts in your address books, the field must
be a whole word. For example, to search contacts by phone number you would
have to enter the full phone number as it appears in the contact entry; you
could not search just by the area code alone.

Before you can use the quick search feature, make sure that you have
selected the type of item you want to search for. The drop-down arrow on
the left of the search box allows you to select which type of items to
search for. You can search for messages, personal contacts, personal and
shared contacts, the Global Address List contacts, pages, or for all
types.

=== Perform a Quick Search

  . In the *Search* text box, enter the content that you want to search
    for. For search options, see <<_search_syntax>>.

  . Select which part of your account to search from the drop-down menu
    next to the Search text box.

  . Press *Enter*.

When you finish the search, click the Search tab.

== Performing an Advanced Search

Instead of typing your keyword and criteria in the Search field, on the
advanced search page you can select from search filters to add more
detailed criteria for your search.

  . In the Search box, click the *magnifying glass*. The advanced search
    page displays.

  . In the Navigation pane, select from the *Advanced Filters* links to
    create your search.
+
The search syntax displays in the Search field at the top of the page. You
can select from any of the filters. As you add new search requirements to
the filters, the search executes and continue to update the results.
+
You can further refine your search criteria by adding and
<<_and_versus_or_searches,And and OR search>> conditions.

  . Click Search.

== Search Filters You Can Use

Refer to the table below for to build more detailed searches.

In the Search tab you can select from advanced filters to build more
complex queries.

[cols="1,2a",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Advanced Filters |Description

|Received from |

Search for certain domains in the message header (From, To, and Cc). The
domains that you can search for are predefined.

|Sent to |

Search for certain domains in the message header (From, To, and Cc). The
domains that you can search for are predefined.

|Date sent |

Search for messages received after, before, or on a selected date. To
search between dates, select *Date sent is before* and then select *Date
sent is after* and enter the date range.

|Attachments |

Search for email based on whether it has an attachment. If you are
searching for a particular type of attachment, select the type from the
list of formats displayed.

|Size |

Search for messages by size (bytes, KB, or MB).

|Status |

Search for messages or contacts based on their status, such as read,
unread, forwarded, or replied to.

|Tag |

Search for messages or contacts that have a specific tag.

|Folder |

Limit search to selected folders.

|=======================================================================

== Search Syntax Rules

You can search for any item, such as a word, first name, last name, phone
number, or domain name. When you are searching for content, there are
certain rules to keep in mind. Searching for content searches the body of
the message, plus any system-readable file attachments.

[cols="1,2a",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option |Description

|Exact text match |

If you search for phrases, each word within that phrase must be an exact
match. Spelling variants are not allowed. For example, if you search for
*bananas*, messages with *banana* are not a match.

|Not case sensitivity |

Search is not case sensitive; *South*, *south*, and *SOUTH* are all the
same thing.

|Special characters |

These special characters cannot be used in your search text. `~ ' ! @ # $ %
^ & * () _ - + ? / { }[ ] ; : "`

|Copyright and Trademark symbols |

Special characters, such as trademark symbols that are part of a word, are
removed when the word is indexed for search. When these special characters
are used in a search query as part of a whole word search, they are
ignored. For example, a search for Zimbraâ„¢ finds all references to Zimbra,
including those without the trademark symbol.

|Wild cards |

The asterisk *\** as a wildcard after a prefix is supported. For example, if
you search for *do**, it returns items with the word *dog*, *door*, etc.

[NOTE]
A double-byte asterisk sign in a search query is not considered a wild card
character and is ignored when the search runs.

|Attachments |

System-readable file attachments are searched. A system-readable file is
one that can be converted to HTML, such as Microsoft Office documents and
text files.

|Contacts in address books |

You must search for a whole word or number string. For example, to search
contacts by phone number, you must enter the full phone number as it
appears in the contact entry. You cannot search just by the area code.

|=======================================================================

[NOTE]
Searching content in the {product-name} differs slightly from text-match
searches or word-processing features such Find.

== Using * as a Wildcard in Search

The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that can be used to match multiple
characters.  Use the wildcard to create searches where there are unknown
characters or various endings. The * wildcard cannot be used as the first
character in a search term.

To use the asterisk as a wildcard, enter the first characters of a search
term and add the *\** at the end. For example, *do** returns items with the
word *dog*, *door*, etc.

== Searching with Key Words

If you know where to search for your item, you can enter keywords followed
by a colon and search item in the Search field.

== Understanding Advanced Search Query Language

This advanced topic describes in detail the search grammar used for
ZCSSearch feature.

=== Search Language Structure

Simple searches can be done by just entering a word into the search
field. Bare words (words without a search operator) are interpreted to
search in the 'content:' operator -- this matches any text in the message.

More advanced searches can be done by specifying a *search operator*. A
search operator is a special keyword followed by a colon, followed by some
other parameter specific to that operator. For example:

  * *in:inbox* the operator is "in" and the parameter is " inbox" - this
    returns messages which are in the folder named " inbox"

  * *from:someone* the operator is "from" and the parameter is "someone" -
    this returns messages which have the word "someone" in their email
    address

You can prefix any keyword with the word "not" to specify items that do not
have that criterion, for example *not in:inbox*. Search is not case
sensitive, meaning that "in:inbox" is the same as "in:Inbox". The minus
sign (-) is a synonym for *NOT* So: *not in:inbox* is the same as
*-in:inbox*

In most cases, it is not necessary to include punctuation-type characters
in your search string, as these are ignored by the search code. There are
certain times where this is not true (for example, searching for a time
'9:30' in a message) and in those cases you should enclose the search
parameter in quotation marks. For example: *subject:"9:30"* will return
messages which have the string 9:30 in the subject.

Allowable characters in the search parameter:

  * The following characters cannot be anywhere in a search parameter unless it is enclosed by quotes: `~ ' ! # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ ? / { }[ ] ; :`

  * The following characters are allowed in a search parameter as long as they are not the first character: `- + < >`

[NOTE]
Special characters, such as trademark symbols that are part of a word, are
removed when the word is indexed for search. They are ignored in a
search. For example, a search for Zimbraâ„¢ finds all references to Zimbra,
including those without the trademark symbol.

=== Multiple Search Terms

If multiple search terms are entered (separated by spaces), they are "
ANDed" together by default. *in:inbox tim* means "return me messages which
are in the inbox AND which have the word tim in them". For searches using
multiple criteria, you can either find items that match one of the
specified criteria or all of them. You can perform both types of searches
from the advanced search page.

For all search panes other than the Basic search, the rules are:

  * Searching for messages that match any of the specified criteria is
    called an '*OR*' search, because if the message contains either X or Y,
    then it is considered a match.

  * Searching for messages that contain both X and Y is called an '*AND*'
    search, because the message must meet all the specified criteria in
    order to be considered a match.

  * Only "OR" appears in a query. If you selected as an option to show the
    search query in the Search bar as you make selections in the Advanced
    search, the Search text box updates to show the resulting query. With
    the '*AND*' type of search, the word '*AND*' does not appear.

[TIP]
Using parenthesis with AND and OR. Words within parentheses are considered
as a unit. For example *from: (john thomas)* is equivalent to *from:john
AND from: thomas*. If you use OR in the parenthesis, *from:(john or
smith)*, the search is for results *from:john OR from: smith*.

=== Using * as a Wildcard in Search

The asterisk (*) can be used as a wildcard at the end of a word in a search
to find content that contains words that have similar spellings.

Use the asterisk *\** as a wildcard. For example, the search string *do** returns items such as *do*, *dog*, *door*, etc.

[NOTE]
A double-byte asterisk sign in a search query is not considered a wildcard
character and is ignored when the search runs.
