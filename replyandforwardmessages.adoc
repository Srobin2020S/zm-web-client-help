== Set Preferences for Email Replies

To reply to the message in the same format it is received, select
Reply/Forward using format of the original message. This ensures that the

    you are including the original message:

    * Select whether to mark the previous responses with a character or
      include the original details in the header (The To, From, and Subject
      fields). You can also include the original message as an attachment.

    * If you want to prefix the previous responses, select either the angle
      bracket (>) or pipe (|).

  . Click *Save*.

== Replying to Email Messages

You can reply to the sender of a message or to the sender and all
recipients.

By default, when you reply to a message, the original message is included
in the body, but the original attachments are not. You can also decide to
prefix each response in the message to track the different replies.

For example, each reply within the message is marked with an angle bracket
(>). The most recent reply has one > before each line, the reply before
that has two (>>), before that three (>>>):

  > Previous message
  > > Message before previous message
  > > > And so forth
